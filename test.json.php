The members of Wigglepussy had the talent to go far and their sound had the originality to set them apart, but they were also very lazy and bad at managing their music career. In the end they self-destructed and allowed their dream to die a premature death. It definitely didn\'t help that they were stuck in a city that cares more about college football than supporting the local Arts. Even though they never had a fanbase bigger than 10-15 loyal fans, they were rock stars in their own minds. Their biggest claim to fame was having parts of three of their songs appear as background music for MTV\'s The Real World and this was ironic considering their music was anti-MTV. DIY filmmaker Mike Newman documented them for most of their existence and then met back up with them two years after they broke up to have them reflect on their crazy experience pursuing their dream together in the creative void known as Middle America. In an ideal world this documentary would help them finally find their audience and even though they changed their name to Blackcat Revival, they will always be remembered as Wigglepussy.","type":"html"},"author":{"name":"Mike Newman"},"media:thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/thumbnails\/wigglepussy_FBnoN7sF.jpeg"},"published":"2011-02-06-11:54:11 AM","format":{"audio_bitrate":null,"width":"624","xmlns":"http:\/\/xmlns.transmission.cc\/FileFormat","channels":"2","samplerate":null,"duration":"5160.0","height":"352","size":"716661318.0","framerate":null,"audio_codec":null,"video_bitrate":null,"video_codec":"AVI","pixel_aspect_ratio":"16:9"},"id":"73444792a48c189b9ff22d08b6c5e1637a5edd3b","title":"We Were Wigglepussy"},{"rights":"Attribution - Noncommercial","link":[{"rel":"alternate","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/deliveredinbeta"},{"rel":"enclosure","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/media\/torrents\/Delivered.in.Beta.2010.Xvid-VODO.torrent","type":"application\/x-bittorrent"},{"rel":"license","href":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/3.0\/","type":"text\/html"}],"content":{"content":"How are social media changing design?

He makes up for the lack of excitement in his life by playing military video games, while he tries to get an idea for an exciting documentary for his college project. Grant connects with (Ryan) online. He\'s a self destructive disillusioned mercenary from Iraq. Ryan agrees to a brief interview with Grant, to talk about war, killing, and missions <p>They meet when Ryan is back in the city to recruit a team of men for a private mission. Grant then begins to realise that Ryan is staging a revenge attack on a mercenary agency in 24 hours. In this city!. Grant ends up documenting the whole prep with Ryan and his men, and also videos the whole assault on the building. An experience that is very different from his video games. <\/p> <h2>Mission X remake<\/h2> <br \/>\n<br \/> <p>I am currently in development to remake \"MissionX\" into a bigger film. This remake version will be a more thriller-action orientated movie for the global video gamer market. The action will be much bigger, kind of like \"Black Hawk Down\" meets \"REC\". We will be introduced to the characters in the first 20 mins, then it will be a battle in a city centre for an hour. <\/p> <p>This time there will be 50 mercenaries from all over the world, and the accents will be more understandable to a wider audience. It will be a very uncompromising gritty and very bloody real action thriller. The reason I also want to remake it, is so that I can create a universe for it that also extends to the web. I expand on this in a video that is on the front of the website<\/p> <h2>Mission X universe<\/h2> <p>If 50 mercenaries attacked a city building for real, everybody would capture it from every pov on their phones. There would be video phone footage in traffic jams, underground trains, from office blocks etc. The media would also do their spin without knowing the facts about the gang. So I plan to shoot around 70 mini videos, and these will be released for free before and after the new movie<\/p> <p>I have always wanted to release extra content about the characters before the movie is released. Video diaries of the gang, headcam footage, CCTV shots in buildings etc. It creates a whole world for the film before released, and helps to flesh out the characters.<\/p> <p>I will also have around 10 fresh trailers, made from content you never even see in the main movie. I hate watching todays trailers, as I feel I have then seen the whole movie. With this, its all fresh content, so the main movie itself is never worn out. I will also encourage others to make their own trailers from the spin off content I upload to many video platforms<\/p> <h2>GET INVOLVED WITH MX REMAKE!<\/h2> <p>If you want to help me create a new type of movie making, that also takes free content like this to the web, please consider supporting my project. I really need an army of supporters to make this happen. I need to control the project to do it right. I plan to start shooting in March 2011<\/p> Any donation level or purchase of perks is extremely appreciated. Everybody that makes a donation will get access to an exclusive behind the scenes \"Making of channel\" during production, post, and release of the film. You will also get many interactive opportunties.","type":"html"},"author":{"name":"David Paul Baker"},"media:thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/thumbnails\/missionx_DQQJUB8a.jpeg"},"published":"2010-11-22-08:44:44 PM","format":{"audio_bitrate":null,"width":"640","xmlns":"http:\/\/xmlns.transmission.cc\/FileFormat","channels":"2","samplerate":null,"duration":"5083.12","height":"480","size":"718358776.0","framerate":null,"audio_codec":"mp3","video_bitrate":null,"video_codec":"avc1","pixel_aspect_ratio":"4:3"},"id":"a484fce3a3159f1c08543bd81f2860e7fd0caccb","title":"MISSION X"},{"rights":"Attribution - No Derivative Works","link":[{"rel":"alternate","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/snowblindmovie"},{"rel":"enclosure","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/torrents\/Snowblind.2010.Xvid-VODO.torrent","type":"application\/x-bittorrent"},{"rel":"license","href":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nd\/3.0\/","type":"text\/html"}],"content":{"content":"<p>A lone gunman gets a last-minute pardon from death row, with the mission to deliver a woman of mysterious powers to an evil Governor.

Please spread the word! <h2>From the Yes Men<\/h2>\n<p>\"We have been impersonating people in power in order to make political points for over a decade.

We are hoping that people who share it will donate some money so that we can do even more outrageous actions.<\/p> <p>How outrageous? Outrageous enough to get us sued! Not long ago The US Chamber of Commerce took us to court for impersonating them. That is why on this special p2p version of the Yes Men Fix the World, we have included an exclusive video that the US Chamber of Commerce does not want you to see. You can only see this surprising film on the exclusive VODO p2p release.<\/p> <p>One final note: making films takes lots of hard work. And money. We busted our asses to make this film and still owe our friends barrels of cash they loaned us. By supporting us and joining the Yes Men Labs, you not only get a membership card and an entry into the prize draw, you also help us to pay all those people back and fund future projects.

Operating under the mission statement of telling the truth and exposing lies, they practice a concept they call \"identity correction\", in which they impersonate entities that they dislike -- some would call it social engineering on a grand scale! From their offices in Milwaukee, they create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have successfully lead to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations. These occasions are then used to expose, through parody and surreal humour, the dark motivations of our multinational world.<\/p>","type":"html"},"author":{"name":"The Yes Men"},"media:thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/media\/thumbnails\/yesmen_thumbnail.jpg"},"published":"2010-07-23-10:47:58 AM","format":{"audio_bitrate":"114.0","width":"640","xmlns":"http:\/\/xmlns.transmission.cc\/FileFormat","channels":"2","samplerate":"44100.0","duration":"5739.0","height":"352","size":"732904952.0","framerate":"29.97","audio_codec":"mp3","video_bitrate":"898.0","video_codec":"Xvid","pixel_aspect_ratio":"1.82"},"id":"2be808c54b33c17ed6a2f8396404a52152bf3047","title":"The Yes Men Fix The World - P2P Edition"},{"rights":"Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works","link":[{"rel":"alternate","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/evun"},{"rel":"enclosure","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/torrents\/Everything.Unspoken.2004.Xvid-VODO.torrent","type":"application\/x-bittorrent"},{"rel":"license","href":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-nd\/3.0\/","type":"text\/html"}],"content":{"content":"Everything Unspoken follows a couple as they\nstruggle to face up to their own\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlimitations and aspirations.

I took my time, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t push, and enjoyed a 30-minute conversation about nothing much at all. I showed her the piece I did on Pat, whom she knows.

Its a cinematic voyage through the visually stunning landscapes of Norrland. The movie starts when Maud, 58, travels to the mountain Galtis to take her life. By chance she accidently witnesses a man committing suicide. The situation is an eye-opener for Maud. She decides that she wants to live and to fullfill his last will \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to drive his Alfa Romeo Spider -73 to his son. During her trip she meets Leo, a 22 year old hipster. Leo has just had a fight with his band and has been thrown off the tour bus when he hitches a ride with Maud. Through the movie we follow how Maud and Leo stop by lakes and mountains, how they talk and how they listen to the northern silence. And how they fight each other. Maud & Leo is a suggestive road movie and the enigmatic inner drama of two people of two different ages who meet, talk, fight, and are slowly forced to open up to one another.","type":"html"},"author":{"name":"jonny von wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m, tobias rydin, akram janzi"},"media:thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/media\/thumbnails\/maudleo_thumb.jpg"},"published":"2010-02-01-12:48:48 PM","format":{"audio_bitrate":null,"width":"624","xmlns":"http:\/\/xmlns.transmission.cc\/FileFormat","channels":"2","samplerate":"0.0","duration":"1590.4","height":"352","size":"367015730.0","framerate":"0.0","audio_codec":"mp3","video_bitrate":"0.0","video_codec":"XVID","pixel_aspect_ratio":"16:9"},"id":"83c9d7c42f483a3af185bb1fc8bb390c2f869960","title":"Maud & Leo"},{"rights":"License Not Specified","link":[{"rel":"alternate","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/hunter"},{"rel":"enclosure","href":"http:\/\/vodo.net\/assets\/torrents\/Hunter.2009.Xvid-VODO.torrent","type":"application\/x-bittorrent"},{"rel":"license","href":"#","type":"text\/html"}],"content":{"content":"Set deep in the woods of Sweden, Hunter explores the tension between the meditative and the violent nature of hunting.
